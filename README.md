# Rust Schotter
> 🌻 🧬 ⏃ Generative Art with Rust

Created following this amazing [Schotter tutorial](https://github.com/sidwellr/schotter)

## Improvements

### schotter1
- hue gradient, squares are transparent

### schotter2
- additional controls for contrast, light vs. dark mode

### schotter3
- additional controls for hue and hue range

### schotter4
- animation is based on time ellapsed, not on frames rendered => more fluid
- eliminated vertical variation of displacement intensity (in the chaotic movement the vertical variation can hardly be observed anyway)
- Reset still possible by pressing 'R' key

### schotter4-hue
- animation is not for displacement, but for the vertical hue variation
- control parameters for hue animation speed & hue variation density
